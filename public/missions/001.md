# Mission // #001
## The Drop
# Goals
-  Land at Forward Operating Base Saber and await further orders.

# Parameters
- Unknown at this time. Hostile forces are confirmed to be operating within Nov Elysia, so anticipate enemy contact; you are cleared to engage if fired upon.

# Stakes
- Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and potentially narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
